                            AZD-AMP3 WinAMP skin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This is my fifth skin . I redesigned Sonicated skin display, changed
  colors of interface to match colors of speakers /made for AZD-Sensor/
  and added my "Sensors" position slider. Windows buttons are completely new.
  All other buttons are corrected, added little glow to led's etc...
  
      So, the new remix was done. I think that it's cool and very functional,
  so I decided to put it on Internet.

  Thanks to YUG Creator of Sonicated display.
